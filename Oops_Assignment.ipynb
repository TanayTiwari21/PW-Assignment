        "-> Method chaining in Python is a programming technique used in object-oriented programming. It allows multiple methods to be called sequentially on the same object in a single line of code. This is achieved by having each method return the object instance (self) after its execution.\n",

        "To implement method chaining, each method in a class that is intended to be chained should include return self as its last statement. This ensures that the method returns the instance of the object, allowing the next method in the chain to be called on the same object.\n",
