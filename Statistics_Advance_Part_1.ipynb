        "\n",
        "Ans: A random variable is a variable whose value is determined by the outcome of a random experiment. It maps outcomes of a probabilistic process to numerical values.\n",
        "\n",

        "Q9. What is the Poisson distribution and where is it applied?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The Poisson distribution models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given the events happen at a constant average rate and independently of the time since the last event.\n",

        "Q10. What is a continuous uniform distribution?\n",
        "\n",

        "Q13. What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and why is it critical in statistics?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "The CLT states that the distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population's distribution. It justifies using normal-based methods in many real-world problems.\n",

        "Q14. How does the Central Limit Theorem relate to the normal distribution?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "Z statistics help determine how far a sample statistic is from the population mean, measured in standard deviations. It's used to assess the significance of test results.\n",

        "Interval Estimate: A range (like a confidence interval) that is likely to contain the population parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q18. What is the significance of confidence intervals in statistical analysis?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "Confidence intervals provide a range of values for the parameter and indicate the uncertainty associated with the estimate. A 95% CI means we are 95% confident the true value lies within the range.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q19. What is the relationship between a Z-score and a confidence interval?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "Z-scores determine the boundaries of a confidence interval in a standard normal distribution. For example, a Z-score of ¬±1.96 corresponds to a 95% confidence level.\n",

        "Q20. How are Z-scores used to compare different distributions?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",

        "Q21. What are the assumptions for applying the Central Limit Theorem?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "\n",
        "Sample size should be large (typically n ‚â• 30)\n",
        "\n",
        "Samples must be independent\n",
        "\n",
        "Population should not be highly skewed for small sample sizes\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "The expected value is the long-run average outcome of a random variable. It is the weighted average of all possible values.\n",
